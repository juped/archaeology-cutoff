urbit is a new programming and execution environment designed from
scratch.

At present urbit is under heavy development. If you're interested in

All of the source code is distributed under the MIT license, but is for

Install
-------

urbit depends on:

    gcc
    gmp
    libsigsegv
    openssl
    automake
    autoconf
    ragel
    cmake
    re2c
    libtool
    libssl-dev (Linux only)
    ncurses (Linux only)

#### Ubuntu or Debian

    sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev libsigsegv-dev openssl libssl-dev libncurses5-dev git make exuberant-ctags automake autoconf libtool g++ ragel cmake re2c

*note: http requests are not supported on either debian wheezy or jessie due to an ssl issue*
#### Fedora

    sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ git gmp-devel openssl-devel openssl ncurses-devel libsigsegv-devel ctags automake autoconf libtool cmake re2c

#### AWS

    sudo yum --enablerepo epel install gcc gcc-c++ git gmp-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel libsigsegv-devel ctags automake autoconf libtool cmake re2c

#### OS X - Homebrew

    brew install git gmp libsigsegv openssl libtool autoconf automake cmake

#### OS X - Macports

    sudo port install git gmp libsigsegv openssl autoconf automake cmake

Although `automake`/`autoconf`/`libtool` are generally installed by
default, some have reported needing to uninstall and reinstall those
three packages, at least with Homebrew. Your mileage may vary.

Build
-----

Clone the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/urbit/urbit.git

`cd` to the directory you just created:

    cd urbit

Just run `make`:

    make

Run
---

Inside of the `urbit` directory run

    bin/urbit -c pier

where `pier` is a directory that does not exist.

All your state (an append-only log and a memory checkpoint) will live in
this directory. The name of your pier doesn't matter and is not visible
internally.

Begin
-----

To begin a 32-bit planet use

    :?begin

which will guide you through the setup process.

Basics
------

`^v` will switch between the task manager and the focussed process. `^x`
will switch between processes.

To start a process that is not yet started, run `*proc` from the task
manager.

To connect your console to a process that has already been started, run `+proc`
from the task manager. Note that the process must be one that supports console
access, such as dojo and talk.

`^d` will exit the pier from the task manager. No matter how you shut
your urbit down you'll be returned to exactly the same state as when you
turned it off.

Talk
----

If `talk` is not running, start it with `*talk` from the task manager.

Use `^x` to switch to the `talk` prompt and then run

    ;join ~doznec/urbit-meta

to join the `urbit-meta` channel. People in there are helpful.

There are four main `talk` commands:

    ;join ~urbit-name/channel

`;join` subscribes your main feed to a remote channel.

    ;create channel %name 'description'

`;create` creates a channel on your urbit.

    ;<number>

`;<number>` activates a previous message number, like a URL that got
clipped.

    ;<target>

`;<target>` sets the target for your messages, such as `;~urbit-name`
for a private message.

Sysadmin
--------

For the most part, updates to the system are automatically synced to
your urbit across the network.

When we make updates to the interpreter you should be able to shut down
your urbit and:

    git pull origin master
    make
    bin/urbit pier

where pier is the name of your pier.

While the network is still young from time to time we reboot the entire
thing. We call this a 'continuity breach' since we're breaking the
continuity of our crypto.

When this happens you'll need to back up your data and start a fresh
pier. Your original ticket will still work.
