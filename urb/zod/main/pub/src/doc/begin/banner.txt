One basic human instinct is the urge to form political tribes.
In a network that fights this need, these tribes form anyway and
they form badly.  Urbit designs them into the infrastructure.
Inspired by the Qing Dynasty, you'll align yourself with one of
five colored "banners" - %red, %blue, %orange, %black or %white.

Political discourse across tribal boundaries is almost always an
antisocial act - less communication, than symbolic violence.  In
Urbit, messages marked political stay within your own banner;
your friends in other banners simply won't see them.  Between
banners, politics doesn't erode apolitical relationships; inside
each banner, political discourse is harmonious and productive.

Pick a banner by the adjective you feel best describes you:

%red     far left: radical, anarchist
%blue    center-left: moderate, liberal
%orange  center-right: conservative, libertarian
%black   far right: traditionalist, reactionary

Or if digital agitation isn't your cup of tea, choose %white, and
your Urbit experience will remain politics-free.
