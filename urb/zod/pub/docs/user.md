# User documentation

Read the [introduction](user/intro) for a summary of Urbit.
The [installation guide](user/install) gets you ready to run.
Launch with [basic operation](user/basic) and get a feel for the
system.  Once your urbit is live, the [walking tour](user/tour)
shows how to do some common tasks.

For power users, the [appliance handbook](user/appliance) explains
your apps and how to control them.  The [filesystem handbook](user/clay) 
explains the Urbit filesystem and how to sync it with Unix.
Finally, the [:dojo manual](user/dojo) and [:talk manual](user/talk) 
explore the fine points of our shell and messenger respectively.
