Subject modification
--------------------

The `=` runes modify the subject. They are used whenever you want to
push something on the subject, modify the subject, or use the results of
one formula in another.

There are three basic categories of `=` runes.

### Replace the subject

[`=>`]() The natural `=` rune. Uses the product of `p` as the subject
for the formula `q`. 

[`=<`]() Inverse of `=>`. Uses the product of `q` as the subject for the 
formula `a`. Used to make code more readable by making it flow vertically.
