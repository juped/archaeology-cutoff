Canonical atom syntaxes

Unsigned decimal, @ud


Hoon's unsigned decimal format is the normal Continental syntax. It differs from the Anglo-American only in the use of periods, rather than commas, between groups of 3:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> 19
19
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> 1.024
1.024

An unsigned decimal not broken into groups is a syntax error. Also, whitespace or even linebreaks can appear between the dot and the next group.

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> 65.  536
65.536

Unsigned hexadecimal, @ux

@ux has the same syntax as @ud, except that it's prefixed by 0x and uses groups of four. Hex digits are lowercase only.

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> 0x0
0x0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`0x17
23

Unsigned base64, @uw

Unsigned base32, @uv

The prefix is 0w for base64 and 0v for base32. The digits for @uw are, in order: 0-9, a-z, A-Z, -, ~:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`0w-
62
For @uv, the digits are 0-9, a-v.

Signed decimal, @sd

Signed hexadecimal, @sx

Signed base64, @sw

Signed base32, @sv

Signed binary, @sb

Obviously, without finite-sized integers, the sign extension trick does not work. A signed integer in Hoon is a different way to use atoms than an unsigned integer; even for positive numbers, the signed integer cannot equal the unsigned.

The prefix for a negative signed integer is a single - before the unsigned syntax. The prefix for a positive signed integer is --. The sign bit is the low bit:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> -1
-1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> --1
--1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`-1
1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`--1
2
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`-2
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`--2
4
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`-0x10
0x1f
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`--0x10
0x20
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`--0w-
124
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@sw`124
--0w-

Absolute date, @da

Urbit dates represent 128-bit chronological time, with 2^64 seconds from the start of the universe to the end. 2^127 is 3:30:08 PM on December 5, AD 226, for reasons not clear or relevant:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@da`(bex 127)
~226.12.5..15.30.08

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@da`(dec (bex 127))
~226.12.5..15.30.07..ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff
The time of day and/or second fragment is optional:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~2013.12.7
0x8000.000d.2140.7280.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~2013.12.7..15.30.07
0x8000.000d.2141.4c7f.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~2013.12.7..15.30.07..1234
0x8000.000d.2141.4c7f.1234.0000.0000.0000
We also do BC:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~226-.12.5
0x7fff.fffc.afb1.b800.0000.0000.0000.0000

The semantics of the time system are that UGT (Urbit Galactic Time) is GMT/UTC as of leap second 25. UGT is chronological and will never add leap seconds, even if UTC continues this mistake. If a gap appears, it must be resolved in the presentation layer, with timezones and other human curiosities.

Relative date, @dr

It's also nice to have a syntax for basic time intervals:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~s1
0x1.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~m1
0x3c.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> (div ~m1 ~s1)
60

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> (div ~h1 ~m1)
60

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> (div ~h1 ~s1)
3.600

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> (div ~d1 ~h1)
24

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@da`(add ~2013.11.30 ~d1)
~2013.12.1
There are no @dr intervals under a second or over a day. Since the resolution is so high, though, (div ~s1 1.000.000) produces a pretty accurate microsecond.

Loobean, @f

A loobean, or just bean, is 0 or 1. 0 is yes, 1 is no:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`.y
0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`.n
1
People who find this strange are probably strange themselves.

Nil, @n

Nil indicates an absence of information, as in a list terminator. The only value is ~, 0.

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`~
0
Unicode text, @t

@t is a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, LSB first - sometimes called a cord. For lowercase numbers and letters, the canonical syntax is ~~text:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> ~~foo
'foo'
Note that the prettyprinter makes an unprincipled exception and prints the text in a noncanonical format:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~~foo
0x6f.6f66
We want to be able to encode an arbitrary Unicode string as a single URL-safe token, using no punctuation but .~-, in @t. Space is ., . is ~., ~ is ~~, - is -:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> ~~foo.bar
'foo bar'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> ~~foo.bar~.baz~~moo-hoo
'foo bar.baz~moo-hoo'
For all other ASCII/Unicode characters, insert the Unicode codepoint in lower-case hexadecimal, followed by .. For example, for U+2605 "BLACK STAR", write:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> ~~foo~2605.bar
'foo★bar'
This UTF-32 codepoint is of course converted to UTF-8:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~~foo~2605.bar
0x72.6162.8598.e26f.6f66
URL-safe ASCII text, @ta

@ta encodes the ASCII subset that all canonical atom syntaxes restrict themselves to. The prefix is ~.. There are no escape sequences except ~~, which means ~, and ~-, which means \_. - and . encode themselves. No other characters besides numbers and lowercase letters need apply.

Let's cast these to @t to see them quoted:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@t`~.foo
'foo'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@t`~.foo.bar
'foo.bar'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@t`~.foo~~bar
'foo~bar'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@t`~.foo~-bar
'foo_bar'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@t`~.foo-bar
'foo-bar'
A @ta atom is called a span.

Codepoint, @c

Normally when we build atoms of Unicode text, we use a UTF-8 bytestream, LSB first. But sometimes it's useful to build atoms of one or more UTF-32 words.

The codepoint syntax is the same as @t, except with a ~- prefix. Let's repeat our examples, with hex display:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~-foo
0x6f.0000.006f.0000.0066

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`~-foo.bar
0x72.0000.0061.0000.0062.0000.0020.0000.006f.0000.006f.0000.0066
Phonemic, @p

We've seen @p used for ships, of course. But it's not just for ships - it's for any short number optimized for memorability, not for arithmetic. @p is great for checksums, for instance.

That said, @p is subtly customized for the sociopolitical design of Urbit as a digital republic. For example, one feature we don't want is the ability to see at a glance which carrier and cruiser issued a destroyer. Consider the carrier 0x21:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x21
~mep
It issues 255 cruisers, including 0x4321:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x4321
~pasnut
Which issues 65.535 destroyers, including 0x8765.4321 and several successors:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x8765.4321
~famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x8766.4321
~lidlug-maprec
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x8767.4321
~tidlus-roplen
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x8768.4321
~lisnel-lonbet
Of course, anyone who can juggle bits can see that ~famsyr-dirwes is a close cousin of ~lidlug-maprec. But she actually has to juggle bits to do it. Obfuscation does not prevent calculated associations, just automatic ones.

But at the yacht level, we actually want to see a uniform 32-bit space of yachts directly associated with the destroyer:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0x9.8765.4321
~talfes-sibzod-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0xba9.8765.4321
~tacbep-ronreg-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0xd.cba9.8765.4321
~bicsub-ritbyt-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@p`0xfed.cba9.8765.4321
~sivrep-hadfeb-famsyr-dirwes

IPv4 address, @if

IPv6 address, @is

Urbit lives atop IP and would be very foolish to not support a syntax for the large atoms that are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

@if is the standard IPv4 syntax, prefixed with .:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`.127.0.0.1
0x7f00.0001
@is is the same as @if, but with 8 groups of 4 hex digits:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`.dead.beef.0.cafe.42.babe.dead.beef
0xdead.beef.0000.cafe.0042.babe.dead.beef
IEEE single-precision, @rs

IEEE double-precision, @rd

IEEE quad-precision, @rq

IEEE half-precision, @rh

Hoon does not yet support floating point, so these syntaxes don't actually work. But the syntax for a single-precision float is the normal English syntax, with a . prefix:

.6.2832             ::  τ as @rs
.-6.2832            ::  -τ as @rs
.~6.2832            ::  τ as @rd
.~-6.2832           ::  -τ as @rd
.~~6.2832           ::  τ as @rh
.~~~6.2832          ::  τ as @rq
(Hoon is a Tauist language and promotes International Tau Day.)

Transparent cell syntax

By adding _, we can encode arbitrary nouns in our safe subset. The prefix to a canonical cell is ._; the separator is _; the terminator is __. Thus:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> ._3_4__
[3 4]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> :type; ._.127.0.0.1_._0x12_19___~tasfyn-partyv__
[.127.0.0.1 [0x12 19] ~tasfyn-partyv]
[@if [@ux @ud] @p]
Those who don't see utility in this strange feature have perhaps never needed to jam a data structure into a URL.

Opaque noun syntax

Speaking of jam, sometimes we really don't care what's inside our noun. Then, the syntax to use is a variant of @uw prefixed by ~, which incorporates the built-in jam and cue marshallers:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> (jam [3 4])
78.241
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@uw`(jam [3 4])
0wj6x
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> (cue 0wj6x)
[3 4]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> ~0wj6x
[3 4]
Noncanonical syntaxes

These are syntaxes for constants which don't fit the canonical character-set constraints.

Hoon symbol, @tas

@tas, a term, is our most exclusive odor. The only characters permitted are lowercase ASCII, - except as the first or last character, and 0-9 except as the first character.

The syntax for @tas is the text itself, always preceded by %. This means a term is always cubical. You can cast it to @tas if you like, but we just about always want the cube:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> %dead-fish9
%dead-fish9

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> -:!>(%dead-fish9)
[%cube p=271.101.667.197.767.630.546.276 q=[%atom p=%tas]]
The empty @tas has a special syntax, $:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> %$
%$
A term without % is not a constant, but a name:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> dead-fish9
! -find-limb.dead-fish9
! find-none
! exit
Loobeans, @f

.y is a little cumbersome, so we can say & and |. The % prefix cubes as usual.

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`&
0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ud`|
1
Cords, @t

The canonical ~~ syntax for @t, while it has its place, is intolerable in a number of ways - especially when it comes to escaping capitals. So @t is both printed and parsed in a conventional-looking single-quote syntax:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> 'foo bar'
'foo bar'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`'foo bar'
0x72.6162.206f.6f66
Escape ' with \:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> 'Foo \'bar'
'Foo \'bar'
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `@ux`'\''
0x27
Strings

Text in Hoon is generally manipulated in two ways, depending on what you're doing: as an atomic cord/span/term, or as a tape which is a list of bytes (not codepoints).

To generate a tape, use double quotes:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> "foo"
"foo"
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> `*`"foo"
[102 111 111 0]
We're getting off the constant reservation, but strings also interpolate with curly-braces:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> "hello {(weld "wor" "ld")} is a fun thing to say"
"hello world is a fun thing to say"
And they can be joined across space or lines with a .:

~waclux-tomwyc/try=> "hello"."world"
"helloworld"
~waclux-tomwyc/try=> "hello". "world"
"helloworld"
