============

Type operations
---------------

The `^` runes perform type operations. With the exception of `^-` and
`^.`, they are all natural runes.

There are three basic categories of `^` runes.

#### Cast values to specific types

[`^-`]() Casts `q` to the type of the [bunt]() of `p`. 

[`^+`]() Casts `q` to the type of `p`.

#### Change the [variance]() of [cores]()

[`^|`]() Converts core from [%gold]() to [%iron](). 

[`^&`]() Converts core from [%gold]() to [%zinc](). 

[`^?`]() Converts core from [%gold]() to [%lead]().

#### Those that add a variable name

[`^=`]() Changes the type of a value by adding a [`++face`]().
