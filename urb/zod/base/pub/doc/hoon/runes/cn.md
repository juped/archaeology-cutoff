============

Pulling
-------

The `%` runes [pull]() [`++arms`]() and [`++wings`]() from the
[subject](), often modifying their values. The `%` runes are similar to
function calls, or execution tools. We use them to either compute some
code with changes in the subject, or produce the output from a core.

There are two categories of `%` runes.

#### Pull with changes:

[`%=`]() The natural `%` rune. Evaluates `p` with the changes specified
in `q`. 

[`%_`]() Evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`, then
casts the product back to the type of `p`. 

[`%*`]() Evaluates `p` from a [door]() `q` with changes `r`.Terminated by `==`.

### Pull the empty arm `$`, similar to calling a function:

[`%-`]() [slams]() a core with one argument. 

[`%+`]() slams a core with two arguments. 

[`%^`]() slams a core with three arguments.
