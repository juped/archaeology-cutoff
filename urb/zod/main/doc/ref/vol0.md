volume 0, Kelvin Versioning
=====================

```
++  hoon  %164                                          ::  version stub
```

Declares the current Hoon version number in degrees Kelvin.

In Kelvin versioning -the true Martian way to permanently freeze a
system- releases count down by integer degrees Kelvin. At absolute
zero, the system can no longer be changed.  At 1K, one more
modification is possible. And so on.
