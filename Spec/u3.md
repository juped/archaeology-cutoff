# u3: noun processing in C.

`u3` is the C library that makes Urbit work.  If it wasn't called
`u3`, it might be called `libnoun` - it's a library for making
and storing nouns.

What's a noun?  A noun is either a cell or an atom.  A cell is an
ordered pair of any two nouns.  An atom is an unsigned integer of
any size.

To the C programmer, this is not a terribly complicated data
structure, so why do you need a library for it?

One: nouns have a well-defined computation kernel, Nock, whose
spec fits on a page and gzips to 340 bytes.  But the only
arithmetic operation in Nock is increment.  So it's nontrivial
to compute both efficiently and correctly.

Two: `u3` is designed to support "permanent computing," ie, a
single-level store which is transparently snapshotted.  This
implies a specialized memory-management model, etc, etc.

(Does `u3` depend on the higher levels of Urbit, Arvo and Hoon?
Yes and no.  It expects you to load something shaped like an Arvo
kernel, and use it as an event-processing function.  But you
don't need to use this feature if you don't want, and your kernel
can be anything you want.)
 
## c3: C in Urbit

Under `u3` is the simple `c3` layer, which is just how we write C 
in Urbit.

When writing C in u3, please of course follow the conventions of
the code around you as regards indentation, etc.  It's especially
important that every function have a header comment, even if it
says nothing interesting.

But some of our idiosyncrasies go beyond convention.  Yes, we've
done awful things to C. Here's what we did and why we did. 

### c3: integer types

First, it's generally acknowledged that underspecified integer
types are C's worst disaster.  C99 fixed this, but the `stdint`
types are wordy and annoying.  We've replaced them with:

    /* Good integers.
    */
      typedef uint64_t c3_d;  // double-word
      typedef int64_t c3_ds;  // signed double-word
      typedef uint32_t c3_w;  // word
      typedef int32_t c3_ws;  // signed word
      typedef uint16_t c3_s;  // short
      typedef int16_t c3_ss;  // signed short
      typedef uint8_t c3_y;   // byte
      typedef int8_t c3_ys;   // signed byte
      typedef uint8_t c3_b;   // bit

      typedef uint8_t c3_t;   // boolean
      typedef uint8_t c3_o;   // loobean
      typedef uint8_t c3_g;   // 32-bit log - 0-31 bits
      typedef uint32_t c3_l;  // little; 31-bit unsigned integer
      typedef uint32_t c3_m;  // mote; also c3_l; LSB first a-z 4-char string.

    /* Bad integers.
    */
      typedef char      c3_c; // does not match int8_t or uint8_t
      typedef int       c3_i; // int - really bad
      typedef uintptr_t c3_p; // pointer-length uint - really really bad
      typedef intptr_t c3_ps; // pointer-length int - really really bad

Some of these need explanation.  A loobean is a Nock boolean -
Nock, for mysterious reasons, uses 0 as true (always say "yes")
and 1 as false (always say "no").

Nock and/or Hoon cannot tell the difference between a short atom
and a long one, but at the `u3` level every atom under `2^31` is
direct.  The `c3_l` type is useful to annotate this.  A `c3_m` is
a mote - a string of up to 4 characters in a `c3_l`, least
significant byte first.  A `c3_g` should be a 5-bit atom.  Of
course, C cannot enforce these constraints, only document them.

Use the "bad" - ie, poorly specified - integer types only when
interfacing with external code that expects them.

An enormous number of motes are defined in `i/c/motes.h`.  There
is no reason to delete motes that aren't being used, or even to
modularize the definitions.  Keep them alphabetical, though.

### c3: variables and variable naming

The C3 style uses Hoon style TLV variable names, with a quasi
Hungarian syntax.  This is weird, but works really well, as
long as what you're doing isn't hideous.

A TLV variable name is a random pronounceable three-letter
string, sometimes with some vague relationship to its meaning,
but usually not.  Usually CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) is a
good choice.

You should use TLVs much the way math people use Greek letters.
The same concept should in general get the same name across
different contexts.  When you're working in a given area, you'll
tend to remember the binding from TLV to concept by sheer power
of associative memory.  When you come back to it, it's not that
hard to relearn.  And of course, when in doubt, comment it.

Variables take pseudo-Hungarian suffixes, matching in general the
suffix of the integer type:

    c3_w wor_w;     //  32-bit word

Unlike in true Hungarian, there is no change for pointer
variables.  Structure variables take a `_u` suffix; 

### c3: loobeans

The code (from `defs.h`) tells the story:

    #     define c3y      0
    #     define c3n      1

    #     define _(x)        (c3y == (x))
    #     define __(x)       ((x) ? c3y : c3n)
    #     define c3a(x, y)   __(_(x) && _(y))
    #     define c3o(x, y)   __(_(x) || _(y))

In short, use `_()` to turn a loobean into a boolean, `__` to go
the other way.  Use `!` as usual, `c3y` for yes and `c3n` for no,
`c3a` for and and `c3o` for or.

## u3: introduction to the noun world

The division between `c3` and `u3` is that you could theoretically
imagine using `c3` as just a generic C environment.  Anything to do
with nouns is in `u3`.

### u3: a map of the system

There are two kinds of symbols in `u3`: regular and irregular.
Regular symbols follow this pattern:

    prefix    purpose                      .h         .c
    -------------------------------------------------------
    u3a_      allocation                   i/n/a.h    n/a.c
    u3e_      persistence                  i/n/e.h    n/e.c
    u3h_      hashtables                   i/n/h.h    n/h.c
    u3i_      noun construction            i/n/i.h    n/i.c
    u3j_      jet control                  i/n/j.h    n/j.c
    u3m_      system management            i/n/m.h    n/m.c
    u3n_      nock computation             i/n/n.h    n/n.c
    u3r_      noun access (error returns)  i/n/r.h    n/r.c
    u3t_      profiling                    i/n/t.h    n/t.c
    u3v_      arvo                         i/n/v.h    n/v.c
    u3x_      noun access (error crashes)  i/n/x.h    n/x.c
    u3z_      memoization                  i/n/z.h    n/z.c
    u3k[a-g]  jets (transfer, C args)      i/j/k.h    j/[a-g]/*.c
    u3q[a-g]  jets (retain, C args)        i/j/q.h    j/[a-g]/*.c
    u3w[a-g]  jets (retain, nock core)     i/j/w.h    j/[a-g]/*.c

Irregular symbols always start with `u3` and obey no other rules.
They're defined in `i/n/u.h`.  Finally, `i/all.h` includes all
these headers (fast compilers, yay) and is all you need to
program in `u3`.

### u3: noun internals

A noun is a `u3_noun` - currently defined as a 32-bit `c3_w`.

If your `u3_noun` is less than `(1 << 31)`, it's a direct atom.
Every unsigned integer between `0` and `0x7fffffff` inclusive is
its own noun.

If bit `31` is set in a `u3_noun`, bit `30` is always set - this
bit is reserved.  Bit `29` is `1` if the noun is a cell, `0` if
it's an atom.  Bits `28` through `0` are a word pointer into the
loom - see below.  The structures are:

    typedef struct {
      c3_w mug_w;
      c3_w len_w;
      c3_w buf_w[0];    //  actually [len_w]
    } u3a_atom;

    typedef struct {
      c3_w    mug_w;
      u3_noun hed; 
      u3_noun tel;
    } u3a_cell;

The only thing that should be mysterious here is `mug_w`, which
is a 31-bit lazily computed nonzero short hash (FNV currently,
soon Murmur3).  If `mug_w` is 0, the hash is not yet computed.
We also hijack this field for various hacks, such as saving the
new address of a noun when copying over.

Also, the value `0xffffffff` is `u3_none`, which is never a valid
noun.  Use the type `u3_weak` to express that a noun variable may
be `u3_none`.

### u3: reference counts

The only really essential thing you need to know about `u3` is
how to handle reference counts.  Everything else, you can skip 
and just get to work.

u3 deals with reference-counted, immutable, acyclic nouns.
Unfortunately, we are not Apple and can't build reference
counting into your C compiler, so you need to count by hand.

Every allocated noun (or any allocation object, because our
allocator is general-purpose) contains a counter which counts the
number of references to it - typically variables with type
`u3_noun`.  When this counter goes to 0, the noun is freed.

To tell `u3` that you've added a reference to a noun, call the
function `u3a_gain()` or its shorthand `u3k()`.  (For your
convenience, this function returns its argument.)  To tell `u3`
that you've destroyed a reference, call `u3a_lose()` or `u3z()`.

(If you screw up by decrementing the counter too much, `u3` will
dump core in horrible ways.  If you screw up by incrementing it
too much, `u3` will leak memory.  To check for memory leaks,
set the `bug_o` flag in `u3e_boot()` - eg, run `vere` with `-g`.
Memory leaks are difficult to debug - the best way to handle
leaks is just to revert to a version that didn't have them, and
look over your code again.)

(You can gain or lose a direct atom.  It does nothing.)

### u3: reference protocols

*THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL SECTION IN THE `u3` DOCUMENTATION.*

The key question when calling a C function in a refcounted world
is what the function will do to the noun refcounts - and, if the
function returns a noun, what it does to the return.

There are two semantic patterns, `transfer` and `retain`.  In
`transfer` semantics, the caller "gives" a use count to the
callee, which "gives back" any return.  For instance, if I have

    {
      u3_noun foo = u3i_string("foobar");
      u3_noun bar;
     
      bar = u3f_futz(foo);
      [...]
      u3z(bar);
    }

Suppose `u3f_futz()` has `transfer` semantics.  At `[...]`, my
code holds one reference to `bar` and zero references to `foo` -
which has been freed, unless it's part of `bar`.  My code now
owns `bar` and gets to work with it until it's done, at which
point a `u3z()` is required.

On the other hand, if `u3f_futz()` has `retain` semantics, we
need to write

    {
      u3_noun foo = u3i_string("foobar");
      u3_noun bar;
     
      bar = u3f_futz(foo);
      [...]
      u3z(foo);
    }

because calling `u3f_futz()` does not release our ownership of
`foo`, which we have to free ourselves.

But if we free `bar`, we are making a great mistake, because our
reference to it is not in any way registered in the memory
manager (which cannot track references in C variables, of
course).  It is normal and healthy to have these uncounted
C references, but they must be treated with care.

The bottom line is that it's essential for the caller to  know
the refcount semantics of any function which takes or returns a
noun.  (In some unusual circumstances, different arguments or
returns in one function may be handled differently.)

Broadly speaking, as a design question, retain semantics are more
appropriate for functions which inspect or query nouns.  For
instance, `u3h()` (which takes the head of a noun) retains, so
that we can traverse a noun tree without constantly incrementing
and decrementing.

Transfer semantics are more appropriate for functions which make
nouns, which is obviously what most functions do.

In general, though, in most places it's not worth thinking about
what your function does.  There is a convention for it, which
depends on where it is, not what it is.  Follow the convention.

### u3: reference conventions
 
The `u3` convention is that, unless otherwise specified, *all
functions have transfer semantics* - with the exception of the
prefixes: `u3r`, `u3x`, `u3z`, `u3q` and `u3w`.  Also, within
jet directories `a` through `f` (but not `g`), internal functions
retain (for historical reasons).

If functions outside this set have retain semantics, they need to
be commented, both in the `.h` and `.c` file, with `RETAIN` in
all caps.  Yes, it's this important.

### u3: system architecture

If you just want to tinker with some existing code, it might be
enough to understand the above.  If not, it's probably worth
taking the time to look at `u3` as a whole.

`u3` is designed to work as a persistent event processor.
Logically, it computes a function of the form

    f(event, old state) -> (actions, new state)

Obviously almost any computing model - including, but not limited
to, Urbit - can be defined in this form.  To create the illusion
of a computer that never loses state and never fails, we:

- log every event externally before it goes into u3
- keep a single reference to a permanent state noun.
- can abort any event without damaging the permanent state.
- snapshot the permanent state periodically, and/or prune logs.

### u3: the road model

`u3` uses a memory design which I'm sure someone has invented
somewhere before, because it's not very clever, but I've never
seen it anywhere in particular.

Every allocation starts with a solid block of memory, which `u3`
calls the `loom`.  How do we allocate on the loom?  You're
probably familiar with the Unix heap-stack design, in which the
stack grows downward and the heap (malloc arena) grows upward:

    0           brk                                          ffff
    |   heap     |                                    stack    |
    |------------#################################+++++++++++++|
    |                                             |            |
    0                                             sp         ffff

A road is a normal heap-stack system, except that the heap
and stack can point in *either direction*.  Therefore, inside
a road, we can nest another road in the *opposite direction*.

When the opposite road completes, its heap is left on top of
the opposite heap's stack.  It's no more than the normal 
behavior of a stack machine for all subcomputations to push
their results on the stack.

The performance tradeoff of "leaping" - reversing directions in
the road - is that if the outer computation wants to preserve the
results of the inner one, not just use them for temporary
purposes, it has to *copy them*.

This is a trivial cost in some cases, a prohibitive cost in 
others.  The upside, of course, is that all garbage accrued
in the inner computation is discarded at zero cost.

The goal of the road system is the ability to *layer* memory
models.  If you are allocating on a road, you have no idea
how deep within a nested road system you are - in other words,
you have no idea exactly how durable your result may be.
But free space is never fragmented within a road.

Roads do not reduce the generality or performance of a memory
system, since even the most complex GC system can be nested
within a road at no particular loss of performance - a road
is just a block of memory.

Each road (`u3a_road` to be exact) uses four pointers: `rut` is
the bottom of the arena, `hat` the top of the arena, `mat` the
bottom of the stack, `cap` the top of the stack.  (Bear in mind
that the road "stack" is not actually used as the C function-call
stack, though it probably should be.)

A "north" road has the stack high and the heap low:

    0           rut   hat                                    ffff
    |            |     |                                       |
    |~~~~~~~~~~~~-------##########################+++++++$~~~~~|
    |                                             |      |     |
    0                                            cap    mat  ffff

A "south" road is the other way around:

    0           mat   cap                                    ffff
    |            |     |                                       |
    |~~~~~~~~~~~~$++++++##########################--------~~~~~|
    |                                             |      |     |
    0                                            hat    rut  ffff

Legend: `-` is durable storage (heap); `+` is temporary storage
(stack); `~` is deep storage (immutable); `$` is the allocation
frame `#` is free memory.

Pointer restrictions: pointers stored in `+` can point anywhere.
Pointers in `-` can only point to `-` or `~`; pointers in `~` 
only point to `~`.

To "leap" is to create a new inner road in the `###` free space.
but in the reverse direction, so that when the inner road
"falls" (terminates), its durable storage is left on the
temporary storage of the outer road.

`u3` keeps a global variable, `u3_Road` or its alias `u3R`, which
points to the current road.  (If we ever run threads in inner
roads - see below - this will become a thread-local variable.)
Relative to `u3R`, `+` memory is called `junior` memory; `-`
memory is `normal` memory; `~` is `senior` memory.

### u3: persistence, events, and the road model

We're now ready to understand why this system works so logically
with the event and persistence model.

The key is that *we don't update refcounts in senior memory.*
A pointer from an inner road to an outer road is not counted.
Also, the outmost, or `surface` road, is the only part of the
image that gets checkpointed.

So the surface road contains the entire durable state of `u3`.
When we process an event, or perform any kind of complicated or
interesting calculation, we process it in an inner road.

Since processing in an inner road does not touch surface memory,
(a) we can leave the surface road in a read-only state and not
mark its pages dirty; (b) we can abort an inner calculation
without screwing up the surface; and (c) because inner results
are copied onto the surface, the surface doesn't get fragmented.

All of (a), (b) and (c) are needed for checkpointing to be easy.
It might be tractable otherwise, but easy is even better.

Moreover, while the surface is most definitely single-threaded,
we could easily run multiple threads in multiple inner roads
(as long as the threads don't have pointers into each others'
memory, which they obviously shouldn't).

### u3: rules for C programming
