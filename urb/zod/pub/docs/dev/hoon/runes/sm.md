Composition
-----------

The `;` runes are used for composition. They are all synthetic.

There are three categories of `;` runes.

</div>

#### Gate composers

[`;:`]() Applies a binary gate to multiple arguments. 

[`;~`]() Uses a monad to compose multiple gates, producing a gate of a similar type.

[`;;`]() Composes a [clam]() with a value, slamming the value through
the clam and forcefully verifying that it is unchanged. See also:
[`++hard`]().

[`;"`]() Composes [`++tapes`]() and twigs that produce `++tape`s.
Generally used in its irregular form, of (text surrounded by double
quotes).

#### [++sail] runes:

`;-`, `;+`, `;*`, `;%`, and `%smzz` all compose a tree structure. See
also: [`++sail`]().
