You've selected a personal identity.  For a %lord or a %lady,
please use your real name only.  If you'd prefer a fictitious
handle, you can hit ^V and start over as a %punk.  Or you can
use %anon and go by your ship name alone.

As a real person, we're going to ask you for a little bit of
personal information - not enough to compromise your privacy,
just enough to make everyone on Urbit feel like a neighbor.

What we're going to ask you for is information that's (a)
public (would be obvious, or at least easy to guess, for
someone who met you in person); (b) durable (doesn't change
often); and (c) relevant (helps you connect with friends).

For example, we'll ask for the year (not day) you were born,
because your age is easy to guess in person, doesn't change,
and has a big effect on how people perceive you.
