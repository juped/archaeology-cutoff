1. Introduction
---------------

The CRE2  distribution is a  C language wrapper for  the RE2
library, which is implemented in  C++.  RE2 is a fast, safe,
thread-friendly   alternative    to   backtracking   regular
expression  engines  like  those  used in  PCRE,  Perl,  and
Python.

  This distribution makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

To install RE2 follow the instructions in the README file in
RE2's.  To  install CRE2 from  a proper release  tarball, do
this:

    $ cd cre2-0.1.0
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  From a repository checkout or  snapshot (the ones from the
Github site): we  may need to manually  run "libtoolize" the
first time, then  we must first run  the script "autogen.sh"
from the top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ sh autogen.sh

for  this  we need  to  have  installed the  GNU  Autotools:
Automake, Autoconf, Libtool.  After this:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/cre2

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/cre2
