Urbit
=====

This is an implementation of C. Guy Yarvin's [Nock][1] axioms, a compiler from
the "Hoon" language to Nock, and other foundations of the [Urbit][2] static
functional namespace.

The interpreter depends on the following packages:

-  GNU Multiprecision library
-  libsigsegv
-  openssl
-  libssl-dev
-  ncurses

You may be able to install these by running

    sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev libev-dev libsigsegv-dev openssl libssl-dev libncurses5-dev


To build the system, run `make OS=osx` or `make OS=linux`.
