  ***TBD - Galen/Anton please fill in

[from unix]
  For A, to build and boot:
      git clone https://github.com/urbit/urbit
      cd urbit
      make
      bin/urbit -T $A -c $A

  For A, to kill and restart from checkpoint:
      [in new terminal] killall -9 urbit
      [in old terminal] urbit $A

  For A, to kill, delete checkpoint, and rerun events:
      [in new terminal] killall -9 urbit; rm -rf $A/.urb/chk
      [in old terminal] urbit $A

  For B, to edit /foo/bar/hoon:
      *** Philip/anyone, add directions to install vim style

      vim urbit/$B/$B/in/$DEMO/foo/bar.hoon


[from talk]
  For A, to private-message B (who defaults to talking back):

      ;~B

  To create a channel '%foobar':

      ;create channel %foobar 'channel description'

[from hood, #]

  For A or B, to start tictactoe:

      *demo/tictactoe

  For A or B, to log in to X's tictactoe:

      +~X/

  To log out:

      -~X/tictactoe

[from dojo]

  For B, to create a %demo desk for this project:

      :+merge %demo ~B %home

  For A, to sync and follow B's demo desk:

      :+sync %demo ~B %demo

[to send bitcoin]
  Start the dæmon(from sole):
      *bit
 
  Auth in (from dojo):
      :bit+auth [reacted-see-asana] 'f771f6dc08910095b2476b033dca62ddcb302b6617e6a7d4d66e194a2a9bd605'

  In webtalk, click on the link and auth in. The password for coinbase account anton.dyudin@tlon.io has been communicated privately.

  Click authorize and then return to the command line.

  To send:

      :bit+send 0c[bitcoin-address] '[qty-of-bitcoin]'

  I recommend sending about .0001 bitcoin (2¢) because it's just over their minimum and it's an account with limited funds.
  With this protocol, the recipient will obviously have to provide their btc address over chat.

  Lastly, on https://blockchain.info/ there is a search bar that allows you to search by address, assuming you wish to display the address
