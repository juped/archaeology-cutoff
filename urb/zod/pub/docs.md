# Urbit documentation

The Urbit doc is divided into three parts: [user doc](docs/user),
[developer doc](docs/dev), and [theory](docs/theory) (whitepaper, essays,
videos, etc).

If you want to try Urbit, start with the user doc.  If you want
to learn about Urbit, try the theory.  Or just start with the
user doc; it doesn't assume any prior knowledge.

The most fun thing to do with Urbit is code, but the developer
doc remains under construction.  Sorry.  We'll have more soon.
