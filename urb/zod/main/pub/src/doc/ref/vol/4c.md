Clay
====

Clay is our filesystem.

The first part of this will be reference documentation for the data types used
by our filesystem.  In fact, as a general guide, we recommend reading and
attempting to understand the data structures used in any Hoon code before you
try to read the code itself.  Although complete understanding of the data
structures is impossible without seeing them used in the code, an 80%
understanding greatly clarifies the code.  As another general guide, when
reading Hoon, it rarely pays off to understand every line of code when it
appears.  Try to get the gist of it, and then move on.  The next time you come
back to it, it'll likely make a lot more sense.

After a description of the data models, we'll give an overview of the interface
that vanes and applications can use to interact with the filesystem.

Finally, we'll dive into the code and the algorithms themselves.  You know, the
fun part.

Data Models
-----------

As you're reading through this section, remember you can always come back to
this when you run into these types later on.  You're not going to remember
everything the first time through, but it is worth reading, or at least
skimming, this so that you get a rough idea of how our state is organized.

The types that are certainly worth reading are `++raft`, `++room`, `++dome`,
`++ankh`, `++rung`, `++rang`, `++blob`, `++yaki`, and `++nori` (possibly in
that order).  All in all, though, this section isn't too long, so many readers
may wish to quickly read through all of it.  If you get bored, though, just
skip to the next section.  You can always come back when you need to.

###`++raft`, formal state

```
++  raft                                                ::  filesystem
          $:  fat=(map ship room)                       ::  domestic
              hoy=(map ship rung)                       ::  foreign
              ran=rang                                  ::  hashes
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the state of our vane.  Anything that must be remembered between calls
to clay is stored in this state.

`fat` is the set of domestic servers.  This stores all the information that is
specfic to a particular ship on this pier.  The keys to this map are the ships
on the current pier.

`hoy` is the set of foreign servers that we know anything about.  This stores
all the information that is specific to a particular foreign ship.  The keys to
this map are all the ships whose filesystems we have attempted to access
through clay.

`ran` is the store of all commits and deltas, keyed by hash.  The is where all
the "real" data we know is stored; the rest is "just bookkeeping".

###`++room`, filesystem per domestic ship

```
++  room                                                ::  fs per ship
          $:  hun=duct                                  ::  terminal duct
              hez=(unit duct)                           ::  sync duch
              dos=(map desk dojo)                       ::  native desk
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the representation of the filesystem of a ship on our pier.

`hun` is the duct we use to send messages to dill to display notifications of
filesystem changes.  Only `%note` gifts should be produced along this duct.
This is set by the `%init` kiss.

`hez`, if present, is the duct we use to send sync messages to unix so that
they end up in the pier unix directory.  Only `%ergo` gifts should be producd
along this duct.  This is set by `%into` and `%invo` kisses.

`dos` is a well-known operating system released in 1981.  It is also the set of
desks on this ship, mapped to their data.

###`++desk`, filesystem branch

```
++  desk  ,@tas                                         ::  ship desk case spur
```

This is the name of a branch of the filesystem.  The default desks are "arvo",
"main", and "try".  More may be created by simply referencing them.  Desks have
independent histories and states, and they may be merged into each other.

###`++dojo`, domestic desk state

```
++  dojo  ,[p=cult q=dome]                              ::  domestic desk state
```

This is the all the data that is specific to a particular desk on a domestic
ship.  `p` is the set of subscribers to this desk and `q` is the data in the
desk.

###`++cult`, subscriptions

```
++  cult  (map duct rave)                               ::  subscriptions
```

This is the set of subscriptions to a particular desk.  The keys are the ducts
from where the subscriptions requests came.  The results will be produced along
these ducts.  The values are a description of the requested information.

###`++rave`, general subscription request

```
++  rave                                                ::  general request
          $%  [& p=mood]                                ::  single request
              [| p=moat]                                ::  change range
          ==                                            ::
```

This represents a subscription request for a desk.  The request can be for
either a single item in the desk or else for a range of changes on the desk.

###`++mood`, single subscription request

```
++  mood  ,[p=care q=case r=path]                       ::  request in desk
```

This represents a request for the state of the desk at a particular commit,
specfied by `q`.  `p` specifies what kind of information is desired, and `r`
specifies the path we are requesting.

###`++moat`, range subscription request

```
++  moat  ,[p=case q=case]                              ::  change range
```

This represents a request for all changes between `p` and `q`.  Note that there
is currently no way to request to be notified only on changes to particular
paths in the filesystem.  You must subscribe to the entire desk.

###`++care`, clay submode

```
++  care  ?(%u %v %w %x %y %z)                          ::  clay submode
```

This specifies what type of information is requested in a subscription or a
scry.

`%u` requests the `++rang` at the current moment.  Because this information is
not stored for any moment other than the present, we crash if the `++case` is
not a `%da` for now.

`%v` requests the `++dome` at the specified commit.

`%w` requests the revsion number of the desk.

`%x` requests the file at a specified path at the specified commit.  If there
is no node at that path or if the node has no contents (that is, if `q:ankh` is
null), then this produces null.

`%y` requests a `++arch` of the specfied commit at the specified path.

`%z` requests the `++ankh` of the specified commit at the specfied path.

###`++arch`, shallow filesystem node

```
++  arch  ,[p=@uvI q=(unit ,@uvI) r=(map ,@ta ,~)]      ::  fundamental node
```

This is analogous to `++ankh` except that the we have neither our contents nor
the ankhs of our children.  The other fields are exactly the same, so `p` is a
hash of the associated ankh, `u.q`, if it exists, is a hash of the contents of
this node, and the keys of `r` are the names of our children.  `r` is a map to
null rather than a set so that the ordering of the map will be equivalent to
that of `r:ankh`, allowing efficient conversion.

###`++case`, specifying a commit

```
++  case                                                ::  ship desk case spur
          $%  [%da p=@da]                               ::  date
              [%tas p=@tas]                             ::  label
              [%ud p=@ud]                               ::  number
          ==                                            ::
```

A commit can be referred to in three ways: `%da` refers to the commit that was
at the head on date `p`, `%tas` refers to the commit labeled `p`, and `%ud`
refers to the commit numbered `p`.  Note that since these all can be reduced
down to a `%ud`, only numbered commits may be referenced with a `++case`.

###`++dome`, desk data

```
++  dome                                                ::  project state
          $:  ang=agon                                  ::  pedigree
              ank=ankh                                  ::  state
              let=@ud                                   ::  top id
              hit=(map ,@ud tako)                       ::  changes by id
              lab=(map ,@tas ,@ud)                      ::  labels
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the data that is actually stored in a desk.

`ang` is unused and should be removed.

`ank` is the current state of the desk.  Thus, it is the state of the
filesystem at revison `let`.  The head of a desk is always a numbered commit.

`let` is the number of the most recently numbered commit.  This is also the
total number of numbered commits.

`hit` is a map of numerical ids to hashes of commits.  These hashes are mapped
into their associated commits in `hut:rang`.  In general, the keys of this map
are exactly the numbers from 1 to `let`, with no gaps.  Of course, when there
are no numbered commits, `let` is 0, so `hit` is null.  Additionally, each of
the commits is an ancestor of every commit numbered greater than this one.
Thus, each is a descendant of every commit numbered less than this one.  Since
it is true that the date in each commit (`t:yaki`) is no earlier than that of
each of its parents, the numbered commits are totally ordered in the same way
by both pedigree and date.  Of course, not every commit is numbered.  If that
sounds too complicated to you, don't worry about it.  It basically behaves
exactly as you would expect.

`lab` is a map of textual labels to numbered commits.  Note that labels can
only be applied to numbered commits.  Labels must be unique across a desk.

###`++ankh`, filesystem node

```
++  ankh                                                ::  fs node (new)
          $:  p=cash                                    ::  recursive hash
              q=(unit ,[p=cash q=*])                    ::  file
              r=(map ,@ta ankh)                         ::  folders
          ==                                            ::
```

This is a single node in the filesystem.  This may be file or a directory or
both.  In earth filesystems, a node is a file xor a directory.  On mars, we're
inclusive, so a node is a file ior a directory.

`p` is a recursive hash that depends on the contents of the this file or
directory and on any children.

`q` is the contents of this file, if any.  `p.q` is a hash of the contents
while `q.q` is the data itself.

`r` is the set of children of this node.  In the case of a pure file, this is
empty.  The keys are the names of the children and the values are, recursively,
the nodes themselves.

###`++cash`, ankh hash

```
++  cash  ,@uvH                                         ::  ankh hash
```

This is a 128-bit hash of an ankh.  These are mostly stored within ankhs
themselves, and they are used to check for changes in possibly-deep
hierarchies.

###`++rung`, filesystem per neighbor ship

```
++  rung  $:  rus=(map desk rede)                       ::  neighbor desks
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the filesystem of a neighbor ship.  The keys to this map are all the
desks we know about on their ship.

###`++rede`, desk state

```
++  rede                                                ::  universal project
          $:  lim=@da                                   ::  complete to
              qyx=cult                                  ::  subscribers
              ref=(unit rind)                           ::  outgoing requests
              dom=dome                                  ::  revision state
          ==                                            ::
```

This is our knowledge of the state of a desk, either foreign or domestic.

`lim` is the date of the last full update.  We only respond to requests for
stuff before this time.

`qyx` is the list of subscribers to this desk.  For domestic desks, this is
simply `p:dojo`, all subscribers to the desk, while in foreign desks this is
all the subscribers from our ship to the foreign desk.

`ref` is the request manager for the desk.  For domestic desks, this is null
since we handle requests ourselves.

`dom` is the actual data in the desk.

###`++rind`, request manager

```
++  rind                                                ::  request manager
          $:  nix=@ud                                   ::  request index
              bom=(map ,@ud ,[p=duct q=rave])           ::  outstanding
              fod=(map duct ,@ud)                       ::  current requests
              haw=(map mood (unit))                     ::  simple cache
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the request manager for a foreign desk.

`nix` is one more than the index of the most recent request.  Thus, it is the
next available request number.

`bom` is the set of outstanding requests.  The keys of this map are some subset
of the numbers between 0 and one less than `nix`.  The members of the map are
exactly those requests that have not yet been fully satisfied.

`fod` is the same set as `bom`, but from a different perspective.  In
particular, the values of `fod` are the same as the values of `bom`, and the
`p` out of the values of `bom` are the same as the keys of `fod`.  Thus, we can
map ducts to their associated request number and `++rave`, and we can map
numbers to their associated duct and `++rave`.

`haw` is a map from simple requests to their values.  This acts as a cache for
requests that have already been made.  Thus, the second request for a
particular `++mood` is nearly instantaneous.

###`++rang`, data store

```
++  rang  $:  hut=(map tako yaki)                       ::
              lat=(map lobe blob)                       ::
          ==                                            ::
```

This is a set of data keyed by hash.  Thus, this is where the "real" data is
stored, but it is only meaningful if we know the hash of what we're looking
for.

`hut` is a map from hashes to commits.  We often get the hashes from
`hit:dome`, which keys them by logical id.  Not every commit has an id.

`lat` is a map from hashes to the actual data.  We often get the hashes from a
`++yaki`, a commit, which references this map to get the data.  There is no
`++blob` in any `++yaki`.  They are only accessible through this map.

###`++tako`, commit reference

```
++  tako  ,@                                            ::  yaki ref
```

This is a hash of a `++yaki`, a commit.  These are most notably used as the
keys in `hut:rang`, where they are associated with the actual `++yaki`, and as
the values in `hit:dome`, where sequential ids are associated with these.

###`++yaki`, commit

```
++  yaki  ,[p=(list tako) q=(map path lobe) r=tako t=@da] ::  commit
```

This is a single commit.

`p` is a list of the hashes of the parents of this commit.  In most cases, this
will be a single commit, but in a merge there may be more parents.  In theory,
there may be an arbitrary number of parents, but in practice merges have
exactly two parents.  This may change in the future.  For commit 1, there is no
parent.

`q` is a map of the paths on a desk to the data at that location.  If you
understand what a `++lobe` and a `++blob` is, then the type signature here
tells the whole story.

`r` is the hash associated with this commit.

`t` is the date at which this commit was made.

###`++lobe`, data reference

```
++  lobe  ,@                                            ::  blob ref
```

This is a hash of a `++blob`.  These are most notably used in `lat:rang`, where
they are associated with the actual `++blob`, and as the values in `q:yaki`,
where paths are associated with their data in a commit.

###`++blob`, data

```
++  blob  $%  [%delta p=lobe q=lobe r=udon]             ::  delta on q
              [%direct p=lobe q=* r=umph]               ::
              [%indirect p=lobe q=* r=udon s=lobe]      ::
          ==                                            ::
```

This is a node of data.  In every case, `p` is the hash of the blob.

`%delta` is the case where we define the data by a delta on other data.  In
practice, the other data is always the previous commit, but nothing depends on
this.  `q` is the hash of the parent blob, and `r` is the delta.

`%direct` is the case where we simply have the data directly.  `q` is the data
itself, and `r` is any preprocessing instructions.  These almost always come
from the creation of a file.

`%indirect` is both of the preceding cases at once.  `q` is the direct data,
`r` is the delta, and `s` is the parent blob.  It should always be the case
that applying `r` to `s` gives the same data as `q` directly (with the
prepreprocessor instructions in `p.r`).  This exists purely for performance
reasons.  This is unused, at the moment, but in general these should be created
when there are a long line of changes so that we do not have to traverse the
delta chain back to the creation of the file.

###`++udon`, abstract delta

```
++  udon                                                ::  abstract delta
          $:  p=umph                                    ::  preprocessor
              $=  q                                     ::  patch
              $%  [%a p=* q=*]                          ::  trivial replace
                  [%b p=udal]                           ::  atomic indel
                  [%c p=(urge)]                         ::  list indel
                  [%d p=upas q=upas]                    ::  tree edit
              ==                                        ::
          ==                                            ::
```

This is an abstract change to a file.  This is a superset of what would
normally be called diffs.  Diffs usually refer to changes in lines of text
while we have the ability to do more interesting deltas on arbitrary data
structures.

`p` is any preprocessor instructions.

`%a` refers to the trival delta of a complete replace of old data with new
data.

`%b` refers to changes in an opaque atom on the block level.  This has very
limited usefulness, and is not used at the moment.

`%c` refers to changes in a list of data.  This is often lines of text, which
is your classic diff.  We, however, will work on any list of data.

`%d` refers to changes in a tree of data.  This is general enough to describe
changes to any hoon noun, but often more special-purpose delta should be
created for different content types.  This is not used at the moment, and may
in fact be unimplemented.

###`++urge`, list change

```
++  urge  |*(a=_,* (list (unce a)))                     ::  list change
```

This is a parametrized type for list changes.  For example, `(urge ,@t)` is a
list change for lines of text.

###`++unce`, change part of a list.

```
++  unce  |*  a=_,*                                     ::  change part
          $%  [%& p=@ud]                                ::  skip[copy]
              [%| p=(list a) q=(list a)]                ::  p -> q[chunk]
          ==                                            ::  
```

This is a single change in a list of elements of type `a`.  For example, `(unce ,@t)` is
a single change in a lines of text.

`%&` means the next `p` lines are unchanged.

`%|` means the lines `p` have changed to `q`.

###`++umph`, preprocessing information

```
++  umph                                                ::  change filter
          $|  $?  %a                                    ::  no filter
                  %b                                    ::  jamfile
                  %c                                    ::  LF text
              ==                                        ::
          $%  [%d p=@ud]                                ::  blocklist
          ==                                            ::
```

This space intentionally left undocumented.  This stuff will change once we get
a well-typed clay.

###`++upas`, tree change

```
++  upas                                                ::  tree change (%d)
          $&  [p=upas q=upas]                           ::  cell
          $%  [%0 p=axis]                               ::  copy old
              [%1 p=*]                                  ::  insert new
              [%2 p=axis q=udon]                        ::  mutate!
          ==                                            ::
```

This space intentionally left undocumented.  This stuff is not known to work,
and will likely change when we get a well-typed clay.  Also, this is not a
complicated type; it is not difficult to work out the meaning.

###`++nori`, repository action

```
++  nori                                                ::  repository action
          $%  [& q=soba]                                ::  delta
              [| p=@tas]                                ::  label
          ==                                            ::
```

This describes a change that we are asking clay to make to the desk.  There are
two kinds of changes that may be made:  we can modify files or we can apply a
label to a commit.

In the `|` case, we will simply label the current commit with the given label.
In the `&` case, we will apply the given changes.

###`++soba`, delta

```
++  soba  ,[p=cart q=(list ,[p=path q=miso])]           ::  delta
```

This describes a set of changes to make to a desk.  The `cart` is simply a pair
of the old hash and the new hash of the desk.  The list is a list of changes
keyed by the file they're changing.  Thus, the paths are paths to files to be
changed while `miso` is a description of the change itself.

###`++miso`, ankh delta

```
++  miso                                                ::  ankh delta
          $%  [%del p=*]                                ::  delete
              [%ins p=*]                                ::  insert
              [%mut p=udon]                             ::  mutate
          ==                                            ::
```

There are three kinds of changes that may be made to a node in a desk.  We can
insert a file, in which case `p` is the contents of the new file.  We can
delete a file, in which case `p` is the contents of the old file.  Finally, we
can mutate that file, in which case the `udon` describes the changes we are
applying to the file.

###`++mizu`, merged state

```
++  mizu  ,[p=@u q=(map ,@ud tako) r=rang]              ::  new state
```

This is the input to the `%merg` kiss, which allows us to perform a merge.  The
`p` is the number of the new head commit.  The `q` is a map from numbers to
commit hashes.  This is all the new numbered commits that are to be inserted.
The keys to this should always be the numbers from `let.dom` plus one to `p`,
inclusive.  The `r` is the maps of all the new commits and data.  Since these
are merged into the current state, no old commits or data need be here.

###`++riff`, request/desist

```
++  riff  ,[p=desk q=(unit rave)]                       ::  request/desist
```

This represents a request for data about a particular desk.  If `q` contains a
`rave`, then this opens a subscription to the desk for that data.  If `q` is
null, then this tells clay to cancel the subscription along this duct.

###`++riot`, response

```
++  riot  (unit rant)                                   ::  response/complete
```

A riot is a response to a subscription.  If null, the subscription has been
completed, and no more responses will be sent.  Otherwise, the `rant` is the
produced data.

###`++rant`, response data

```
++  rant                                                ::  namespace binding
          $:  p=[p=care q=case r=@tas]                  ::  clade release book
              q=path                                    ::  spur
              r=*                                       ::  data
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the data at a particular node in the filesystem.  `p.p` specifies the
type of data that was requested (and is produced).  `q.p` gives the specific
version reported (since a range of versions may be requested in a
subscription).  `r.p` is the desk.  `q` is the path to the filesystem node.
`r` is the data itself (in the format specified by `p.p`).

Interface
---------

As with all vanes, there are exactly two ways to interact with clay.  Clay
exports a namespace accessible through `.^`, which is described above under
`++care`.  The primary way of interacting with clay, though, is by sending
kisses and receiving gifts.

```
++  gift                                                ::  out result <-$
          $%  [%ergo p=@p q=@tas r=@ud]                 ::  version update
              [%note p=@tD q=tank]                      ::  debug message
              [%writ p=riot]                            ::  response
          ==                                            ::
++  kiss                                                ::  in request ->$
          $%  [%info p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal edit
              [%ingo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal noun edit
              [%init p=@p]                              ::  report install
              [%into p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external edit
              [%invo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external noun edit
              [%merg p=@p q=@tas r=mizu]                ::  internal change
              [%wake ~]                                 ::  timer activate
              [%wart p=sock q=@tas r=path s=*]          ::  network request
              [%warp p=sock q=riff]                     ::  file request
          ==                                            ::
```

There are only a small number of possible kisses, so it behooves us to describe
each in detail.

```
          $%  [%info p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal edit
```

```
              [%into p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external edit
```

These two kisses are nearly identical.  At a high level, they apply changes to
the filesystem.  Whenever we add, remove, or edit a file, one of these cards is
sent.  The `p` is the ship whose filesystem we're trying to change, the `q` is
the desk we're changing, and the `r` is the request change.  For the format of
the requested change, see the documentation for `++nori` above.

When a file is changed in the unix filesystem, vere will send a `%into` kiss.
This tells clay that the duct over which the kiss was sent is the duct that
unix is listening on for changes.  From within Arvo, though, we should never
send a `%into` kiss.  The `%info` kiss is exactly identical except it does not
reset the duct.


```
              [%ingo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal noun edit
```

```
              [%invo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external noun edit
```

These kisses are currently identical to `%info` and `%into`, though this will
not always be the case.  The intent is for these kisses to allow typed changes
to clay so that we may store typed data.  This is currently unimplemented.

```
              [%init p=@p]                              ::  report install
```

Init is called when a ship is started on our pier.  This simply creates a
default `room` to go into our `raft`.  Essentially, this initializes the
filesystem for a ship.

```
              [%merg p=@p q=@tas r=mizu]                ::  internal change
```

This is called to perform a merge.  This is most visibly called by :update to
update the filesystem of the current ship to that of its sein.  The `p` and `q`
are as in `%info`, and the `r` is the description of the merge.  See `++mizu`
above.

```
              [%wake ~]                                 ::  timer activate
```

This card is sent by unix at the time specified by `++doze`.  This time is
usually the closest time specified in a subscription request.  When `%wake` is
called, we update our subscribers if there have been any changes.

```
              [%wart p=sock q=@tas r=path s=*]          ::  network request
```

This is a request that has come across the network for a particular file.  When
another ship asks for a file from us, that request comes to us in the form of a
`%wart` kiss.  This is handled by trivially turning it into a `%warp`.

```
              [%warp p=sock q=riff]                     ::  file request
```

This is a request for information about a particular desk.  This is, in its
most general form, a subscription, though in many cases it is the trivial case
of a subscription -- a read.  See `++riff` for the format of the request.

Lifecycle of a Local Read
-------------------------

There are two real types of interaction with a filesystem:  you can read, and
you can write.  We'll describe each process, detailing both the flow of control
followed by the kernel and the algorithms involved.  The simpler case is that
of the read, so we'll begin with that.

When a vane or an application wishes to read a file from the filesystem, it
sends a `%warp` kiss, as described above.  Of course, you may request a file on
another ship and, being a global filesystem, clay will happily produce it for
you.  That code pathway will be described in another section; here, we will
restrict ourselves to examining the case of a read from a ship on our own pier.

The kiss can request either a single version of a file or a range of versions
of a desk.  We'll trace through both paths at once.

As in all vanes, a kiss enters clay via a call to `++call`.  Scanning through
the arm, we quickly see where `%warp` is handled.

```
        ?:  =(p.p.q.hic q.p.q.hic)
          =+  une=(un p.p.q.hic now ruf)
          =+  wex=(di:une p.q.q.hic)
          =+  ^=  wao
            ?~  q.q.q.hic
              (ease:wex hen)
            (eave:wex hen u.q.q.q.hic)
          =+  ^=  woo
            abet:wao
          [-.woo abet:(pish:une p.q.q.hic +.woo ran.wao)]
```

We're following the familar patern of producing a list of moves and an updated
state.  In this case, the state is `++raft`.

We first check to see if the sending and receiving ships are the same.  If
they're not, then this is a request for data on another ship.  We describe that
process later.  Here, we discuss only the case of a local read.

At a high level, the call to `++un` sets up the core for the domestic ship that
contains the files we're looking for.  The call to `++di` sets up the core for
the particular desk we're referring to.

After this, we perform the actual request.  If there is no rave in the riff,
then that means we are cancelling a request, so we call `++ease:de`.
Otherwise, we start a subscription with `++eave:de`.  We call `++abet:de` to
resolve our various types of output into actual moves.  We produce the moves we
found above and the `++un` core resolved with `++pish:un` (putting the modified
desk in the room) and `++abet:un` (putting the modified room in the raft).

Much of this is fairly straightforward, so we'll only describe `++ease`,
`++eave`, and `++abet:de`.  Feel free to look up the code to the other steps --
it should be easy to follow.

Although it's called last, it's usually worth examining `++abet` first, since
it defines in what ways we can cause side effects.  Let's do that, and also a
few of the lines at the beginning of `++de`.

```
    =|  yel=(list ,[p=duct q=gift])
    =|  byn=(list ,[p=duct q=riot])
    =|  vag=(list ,[p=duct q=gift])
    =|  say=(list ,[p=duct q=path r=ship s=[p=@ud q=riff]])
    |%
    ++  abet
      ^-  [(list move) rede]
      :_  red
      ;:  weld
        %+  turn  (flop yel)
        |=([a=duct b=gift] [hun %give b])
      ::
        %+  turn  (flop byn)
        |=([a=duct b=riot] [a %give [%writ b]])
      ::
        %+  turn  (flop vag)
        |=([a=duct b=gift] [a %give b])
      ::
        %+  turn  (flop say)
        |=  [a=duct b=path c=ship d=[p=@ud q=riff]]
        :-  a
        [%pass b %a %want [who c] [%q %re p.q.d (scot %ud p.d) ~] q.d]
      ==
```

This is very simple code.  We see there are exactly four different kinds of
side effects we can generate.

In `yel` we put gifts that we wish to be sent along the `hun:room` duct to
dill.  See the documentation for `++room` above.  This is how we display
messages to the terminal.

In `byn` we put riots that we wish returned to subscribers.  Recall that a riot
is a response to a subscription.  These are returned to our subscribers in the
form of a `%writ` gift.

In `vag` we put gifts along with the ducts on which to send them.  This allows
us to produce arbitrary gifts, but in practice this is only used to produce
`%ergo` gifts.

In `say` we put messages we wish to pass to ames.  These messages are used to
request information from clay on other piers.  We must provide not only the
duct and the request (the riff), but also the return path, the other ship to
talk to, and the sequence number of the request.

Now that we know what kinds of side effects we may have, we can jump into the
handling of requests.

```
    ++  ease                                          ::  release request
      |=  hen=duct
      ^+  +>
      =.  qyx  (~(del by qyx) hen)
      ?~  ref  +>
      |-  ^+  +>+.$
      =+  nux=(~(get by fod.u.ref) hen)
      ?~  nux  +>+.$
      %=  +>+.$
        say        [[hen [(scot %ud u.nux) ~] for [u.nux syd ~]] say]
        fod.u.ref  (~(del by fod.u.ref) hen)
        bom.u.ref  (~(del by bom.u.ref) u.nux)
      ==
```

This is called when we're cancelling a subscription.  First, we remove the duct
from our map of subscribers.  For domestic desks, `ref` is null, so we're done.
Although we said we're not going to talk about foreign requests yet, it's easy
to see that for foreign desks, we cancel any outstanding requests for this duct
and send a message over ames to the other ship telling them to cancel the
subscription.

The more interesting case is, of course, when we're not cancelling a
subscription but starting one.

```
    ++  eave                                          ::  subscribe
      |=  [hen=duct rav=rave]
      ^+  +>
      ?-    -.rav
          &
        ?:  &(=(p.p.rav %u) !=(p.q.p.rav now))
          ~&  [%clay-fail p.q.p.rav %now now]
          !!
        =+  ver=(aver p.rav)
        ?~  ver
          (duce hen rav)
        ?~  u.ver
          (blub hen)
        (blab hen p.rav u.u.ver)
```

There are two types of subscriptions -- either we're requesting a single file
or we're requesting a range of versions of a desk.  We'll dicuss the simpler
case first.

First, we check that we're not requesting the `rang` from any time other than
the present.  Since we don't store that information for any other time, we
can't produce it in a referentially transparent manner for any time other than
the present.

Then, we try to read the requested `mood` `p.rav`.  If we can't access the
request data right now, we call `++duce` to put the request in our queue to be
satisfied when the information becomes available.  The code for `++duce` is
nearly the exact inverse of `++ease`, which in the case of a domestic desk is
very simple -- we simply put the duct and rave into `qyx`.  This case occurs
when we make a request for a case whose (1) date is after the current date, (2)
number is after the current number, or (3) label is not yet used.

If `++aver` returned `[~ ~]`, then we cancel the subscription.  This occurs
when we make (1) a `%x` request for a file that does not exist, (2) a `%w`
request with a case that is not a number, or (3) a `%w` request with a nonempty
path.  The `++blub` is exactly what you would expect it to be.

```
    ++  blub                                          ::  ship stop
      |=  hen=duct
      %_(+> byn [[hen ~] byn])
```

We notify the duct that we're cancelling their subscription since it isn't
satisfiable.

Otherwise, we have received the desired information, so we send it on to the
subscriber with `++blab`.

```
    ++  blab                                          ::  ship result
      |=  [hen=duct mun=mood dat=*]
      ^+  +>
      +>(byn [[hen ~ [p.mun q.mun syd] r.mun dat] byn])
```

The most interesting arm called in `++eave` is, of course, `++aver`, where we
actually try to read the data.

```
    ++  aver                                          ::  read
      |=  mun=mood
      ^-  (unit (unit ,*))
      ?:  &(=(p.mun %u) !=(p.q.mun now))              ::  prevent bad things
        ~&  [%clay-fail p.q.mun %now now]
        !!
      =+  ezy=?~(ref ~ (~(get by haw.u.ref) mun))
      ?^  ezy  ezy
      =+  nao=(~(aeon ze lim dom ran) q.mun)
      ::  ~&  [%aver-mun nao [%from syd lim q.mun]]
      ?~(nao ~ [~ (~(avid ze lim dom ran) u.nao mun)])
```

We check immediately that we're not requesting the `rang` for any time other
than the present.

If this is a foreign desk, then we check our cache for the specific request.
If either this is a domestic desk or we don't have the request in our cache,
then we have to actually go read the data from our dome.

We need to do two things.  First, we try to find the number of the commit
specified by the given case, and then we try to get the data there.

Here, we jump into `arvo/zuse.hoon`, which is where much of the algorithmic
code is stored, as opposed to the clay interface, which is stored in
`arvo/clay.hoon`.  We examine `++aeon:ze`.

```
  ++  aeon                                              ::    aeon:ze
    |=  lok=case                                        ::  act count through
    ^-  (unit ,@ud)
    ?-    -.lok
        %da
      ?:  (gth p.lok lim)  ~
      |-  ^-  (unit ,@ud)
      ?:  =(0 let)  [~ 0]                               ::  avoid underflow
      ?:  %+  gte  p.lok 
          =<  t
          %-  ~(got by hut)
          %-  ~(got by hit)
          let
        [~ let]
      $(let (dec let))
    ::
        %tas  (~(get by lab) p.lok)
        %ud   ?:((gth p.lok let) ~ [~ p.lok])
    ==
```

We handle each type of `case` differently.  The latter two types are easy.

If we're requesting a revision by label, then we simply look up the requested
label in `lab` from the given dome.  If it exists, that is our number; else we
produce null, indicating the requested revision does not yet exist.

If we're requesting a revision by number, we check if we've yet reached that
number.  If so, we produce the number; else we produce null.

If we're requesting a revision by date, we check first if the date is in the
future, returning null if so.  Else we start from the most recent revision and
scan backwards until we find the first revision committed before that date, and
we produce that.  If we requested a date before any revisions were committed,
we produce `0`.

Assuming we got a valid version number, `++aver` calls `++avid:ze`, which reads
the requested data at the given revision.

```
  ++  avid                                              ::    avid:ze
    |=  [oan=@ud mun=mood]                              ::  seek and read
    ^-  (unit)
    ?:  &(?=(%w p.mun) !?=(%ud -.q.mun))                ::  NB only for speed
      ?^(r.mun ~ [~ oan])
    (auto:(argo oan) mun)
```

If we're requesting the revision number with a case other than by number, then
we go ahead and just produce the number we were given.  Otherwise, we call
`++argo` to rewind our state to the given revision, and then we call `++auto`
to get the requested information.

```
  ++  argo                                              ::    argo:ze
    |=  oan=@ud                                         ::  rewind to aeon
    ^+  +>
    ?:  =(let oan)  +>
    ?:  (gth oan let)  !!                               ::  don't have this version
    +>(ank (azel q:(~(got by hut) (~(got by hit) oan))), let oan)
```

If we're already at the requested version, we do nothing.  If we're requesting
a version later than our head, we are unable to comply.

Otherwise, we get the hash of the commit at the number, and from that we get
the commit itself (the yaki), which has the map of path to lobe that represents
a version of the filesystem.  We call `++azel` to checkout the commit, and we
replace `ank` in our context with the result.

```
  ++  azel                                              ::    azel:ze
    |=  hat=(map path lobe)                             ::  checkout commit
    ^-  ankh
    %-  cosh
    %+  roll  (~(tap by hat) ~)
    |=  [[pat=path bar=lobe] ank=ankh]
    ^-  ankh
    %-  cosh
    ?~  pat
      =+  zar=(zaul bar)
      ank(q [~ (sham zar) zar])
    =+  nak=(~(get by r.ank) i.pat)
    %=  ank
      r  %+  ~(put by r.ank)  i.pat 
         $(pat t.pat, ank (fall nak _ankh))
    ==
```

Twice we call `++cosh`, which hashes a commit, updating `p` in an `ankh`.
Let's jump into that algorithm before we describe `++azel`.

```
++  cosh                                                ::  locally rehash
  |=  ank=ankh
  ank(p dash:(zu ank))
```

We simply replace `p` in the hash with the `cash` we get from a call to
`++dash:zu`.

```
++  zu  !:                                              ::  filesystem
  |=  ank=ankh                                          ::  filesystem state
  =|  myz=(list ,[p=path q=miso])                       ::  changes in reverse
  =|  ram=path                                          ::  reverse path into
  |%
  ++  dash                                              ::  local rehash
    ^-  cash
    %+  mix  ?~(q.ank 0 p.u.q.ank)
    =+  axe=1
    |-  ^-  cash
    ?~  r.ank  _@
    ;:  mix
      (shaf %dash (mix axe (shaf %dush (mix p.n.r.ank p.q.n.r.ank))))
      $(r.ank l.r.ank, axe (peg axe 2))
      $(r.ank r.r.ank, axe (peg axe 3))
    ==
```

`++zu` is a core we set up with a particular filesystem node to traverse a
checkout of the filesystem and access the actual data inside it.  One of the
things we can do with it is to create a recursive hash of the node.

In `++dash`, if this node is a file, then we xor the remainder of the hash with
the hash of the contents of the file.  The remainder of the hash is `0` if we
have no children, else we descend into our children.  Basically, we do a half
SHA-256 of the xor of the axis of this child and the half SHA-256 of the xor of
the name of the child and the hash of the child.  This is done for each child
and all the results are xored together.

Now we return to our discussion of `++azel`.

We fold over every path in this version of the filesystem and create a great
ankh out of them.  First, we call `++zaul` to get the raw data referred to be
each lobe.

```
  ++  zaul                                              ::  grab blob
    |=  p=lobe                                          ::  ^-  *
    %-  zaru  
    (zaal p)
```

This converts a lobe into the raw data it refers to by first getting the blob
with `++zaal` and converting that into data with `++zaru`.

```
  ++  zaal                                              ::  grab blob
    |=  p=lobe                                          ::  (raw)
    ^-  blob
    (~(got by lat) p)
```

This just grabs the blob that the lobe refers to.

```
  ++  zaru                                              ::  grab blob
    |=  p=blob
    ?-   -.p
       %delta  (lump r.p (zaul q.p))
       %direct  q.p
       %indirect  q.p
    ==
```

If we have either a direct or an indirect blob, then the data is stored right
in the blob.  Otherwise, we have to reconstruct it from the diffs.  We do this
by calling `++lump` on the diff in the blob with the data obtained by
recursively calling the parent of this blob.

```
++  lump                                                ::  apply patch
  |=  [don=udon src=*]
  ^-  *
  ?+    p.don  ~|(%unsupported !!)
      %a
    ?+  -.q.don  ~|(%unsupported !!)
      %a  q.q.don
      %c  (lurk ((hard (list)) src) p.q.don)
      %d  (lure src p.q.don)
    ==
  ::
      %c
    =+  dst=(lore ((hard ,@) src))
    %-  roly
    ?+  -.q.don  ~|(%unsupported !!)
      %a  ((hard (list ,@t)) q.q.don)
      %c  (lurk dst p.q.don)
    ==
  ==
```

This is defined in `arvo/hoon.hoon` for historical reasons which are likely no
longer applicable.  Since the `++umph` structure will likely change we convert
clay to be a typed filesystem, we'll only give a high-level description of this
process.  If we have a `%a` udon, then we're performing a trivial replace, so
we produce simply `q.q.don`.  If we have a `%c` udon, then we're performing a
list merge (as in, for example, lines of text).  The merge is performed by
`++lurk`.

```
++  lurk                                                ::  apply list patch
  |*  [hel=(list) rug=(urge)]
  ^+  hel
  =+  war=`_hel`~
  |-  ^+  hel
  ?~  rug  (flop war)
  ?-    -.i.rug
      &
    %=   $
      rug  t.rug
      hel  (slag p.i.rug hel)
      war  (weld (flop (scag p.i.rug hel)) war)
    ==
  ::
      |
    %=  $
      rug  t.rug
      hel  =+  gur=(flop p.i.rug)
           |-  ^+  hel
           ?~  gur  hel
           ?>(&(?=(^ hel) =(i.gur i.hel)) $(hel t.hel, gur t.gur))
      war  (weld q.i.rug war)
    ==
  ==
```

We accumulate our final result in `war`.  If there's nothing more in our list
of merge instructions (unces), we just reverse `war` and produce it.
Otherwise, we process another unce.  If the unce is of type `&`, then we have
`p.i.rug` lines of no changes, so we just copy them over from `hel` to `war`.
If the unice is of type `|`, then we verify that the source lines (in `hel`)
are what we expect them to be (`p.i.rug`), crashing on failure.  If they're
good, then we append the new lines in `q.i.rug` onto `war`.

And that's really it.  List merges are pretty easy.  Anyway, if you recall, we
were discussing `++azel`.

```
  ++  azel                                              ::    azel:ze
    |=  hat=(map path lobe)                             ::  checkout commit
    ^-  ankh
    %-  cosh
    %+  roll  (~(tap by hat) ~)
    |=  [[pat=path bar=lobe] ank=ankh]
    ^-  ankh
    %-  cosh
    ?~  pat
      =+  zar=(zaul bar)
      ank(q [~ (sham zar) zar])
    =+  nak=(~(get by r.ank) i.pat)
    %=  ank
      r  %+  ~(put by r.ank)  i.pat 
         $(pat t.pat, ank (fall nak _ankh))
    ==
```

If the path is null, then we calculate `zar`, the raw data at the path `pat` in
this version.  We produce the given ankh with the correct data.

Otherwise, we try to get the child we're looking at from our parent `ankh`.  If
it's already been created, this succeeds; otherwise, we simply create a default
blank ankh.  We place ourselves in our parent after recursively computing our
children.

This algorithm really isn't that complicated, but it may not be immediately
obvious why it works.  An example should clear everything up.

Suppose `hat` is a map of the following information.

    /greeting                 -->  "customary upon meeting"
    /greeting/english         -->  "hello"
    /greeting/spanish         -->  "hola"
    /greeting/russian/short   -->  "привет"
    /greeting/russian/long    -->  "Здравствуйте"
    /farewell/russian         -->  "до свидания"

Furthermore, let's say that we process them in this order:

    /greeting/english
    /greeting/russian/short
    /greeting/russian/long
    /greeting
    /greeting/spanish
    /farewell/russian

Then, the first path we process is `/greeting/english` .  Since our path is not
null, we try to get `nak`, but because our ankh is blank at this point it
doesn't find anything.  Thus, update our blank top-level ankh with a child
`%greeting`. and recurse with the blank `nak` to create the ankh of the new
child.

In the recursion, we our path is `/english` and our ankh is again blank.  We
try to get the `english` child of our ankh, but this of course fails.  Thus,
we update our blank `/greeting` ankh with a child `english` produced by recursing.

Now our path is null, so we call `++zaul` to get the actual data, and we place
it in the brand-new ankh.

Next, we process `/greeting/russian/short`.  Since our path is not null, we try
to get the child named `%greeting`, which does exist since we created it
earlier.  We put modify this child by recursing on it.  Our path is now
`/russian/short`, so we look for a `%russian` child in our `/greeting` ankh.
This doesn't exist, so we add it by recursing.  Our path is now `/short`, so we
look for a `%short` child in our `/greeting/russian` ankh.  This doesn't exist,
so we add it by recursing.  Now our path is null, so we set the contents of
this node to `"привет"`, and we're done processing this path.

Next, we process `/greeting/russian/long`.  This proceeds similarly to the
previous except that now the ankh for `/greeting/russian` already exists, so we
simply reuse it rather than creating a new one.  Of course, we still must
create a new `/greeting/russian/long` ankh.

Next, we process `/greeting`.  This ankh already exists, so after we've
recursed once, our path is null, and our ankh is not blank -- it already has
two children (and two grandchildren).  We don't touch those, though, since a
node may be both a file and a directory.  We just add the contents of the file
-- "customary upon meeting" -- to the existing ankh.

Next, we process `/greeting/spanish`.  Of course, the `/greeting` ankh already
exists, but it doesn't have a `%spanish` child, so we create that, taking care
not to disturb the contents of the `/greeting` file.  We put "hola" into the
ankh and call it good.

Finally, we process `/farewell/russian`.  Here, the `/farewell` ankh doesn't
exist, so we create it.  Clearly the newly-created ankh doesn't have any
children, so we have to add a `%russian` child, and in this child we put our
last content -- "до свидания".

We hope it's fairly obvious that the order we process the paths doesn't affect
the final ankh tree.  The tree will be constructed in a very different order
depending on what order the paths come in, but the resulting tree is
independent of order.

At any rate, we were talking about something important, weren't we?  If you
recall, that concludes our discussion of `++argo`, which was called from
`++avid`.  In summary, `++argo` returns a context in which our current state is
(very nearly) as it was when the specified version of the desk was the head.
This allows `++avid` to call `++auto` to read the requested information.

```
  ++  auto                                              ::    auto:ze
    |=  mun=mood                                        ::  read at point
    ^-  (unit)
    ?:  ?=(%v p.mun)
      [~ `dome`+<+<.auto]
    ?:  &(?=(%w p.mun) !?=(%ud -.q.mun))
      ?^(r.mun ~ [~ let])
    ?:  ?=(%w p.mun)
      =+  ^=  yak
          %-  ~(got by hut)
          %-  ~(got by hit)
          let
      ?^(r.mun ~ [~ [t.yak (azul yak)]])
      ::?>  ?=(^ hit)  ?^(r.mun ~ [~ i.hit])              ::  what do?? need [@da nori]
    (amor(ank ank:(deny:(zu ank) r.mun)) p.mun)
```

If we're requesting the dome, then we just return that immediately.

If we're requesting the revision number of the desk and we're not requesting it
by number, then we just return the current number of this desk.  Note of course
that this was really already handled in `++avid`.

```
